# FlightSurety
This repository contains my submission for the forth project in Udacity's Blockchain course, called FlightSurety. The project is a dapp for buying inscurance from Airlines for flights. The dapp uses oracles to stimulate the events that cause the flight to be late, which cause to  admit inscurace to the passengers.

## Specification
* Truffle   - v5.1.5 (core: 5.1.5)
* Solidity  - ^0.4.24 (solc-js)
* Node      - v10.7.0
* Web3.js   - v1.2.1
